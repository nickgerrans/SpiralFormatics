# Spiral Formatics Quantum Gravity

This repository contains the original foundational documents of **Spiral Formatics Quantum Gravity**, a geometric framework unifying discrete curvature, spectral dynamics, and field coupling.

Authored by **Nicholas Gerrans**, this framework combines:

- **Formatics** ‚Äî a directional geometry system based on angular resolution, simplex structure, and vertex space recursion
- **Spiral Field Theory** ‚Äî a spectral Laplacian over log-primes encoding compressed curvature dynamics
- **Quantum Gravity Action** ‚Äî defined via triangle microstates, curvature-field coupling, and discrete shell quantization
