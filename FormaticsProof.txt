\subsection*{A.4 Recursive Formatics (Symbolic Axioms and Theorems)}

\textbf{Axiom 7 — Bounded Container Required for Stabilization}

\textit{Explanation: Formatics resolution requires a finite container to stabilize direction. In 2D and 3D this is a circle or sphere, respectively. For higher-dimensional generalization, this becomes a minimal symmetric convex hull enclosing all direction vectors.}

\[
\neg\text{Bounded}(\vec{v}_i) \Rightarrow \neg\text{Stabilize}(\{\vec{v}_i\})
\]
\[
\text{Container}(r) \in \{\text{Circle}, \text{Sphere}, \text{Hull}_n\} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathcal{V}_n(\{\vec{v}_i\}, r)

\[
\mathcal{V}_n(D, r) \Rightarrow \text{SubV}_1(\mathcal{V}_n(D', r/2), \text{depth } 1)
\]
\[
\text{where } D' \subseteq \text{TriangleCenters}(\text{Stabilize}(D))
\]
\textit{Explanation: Triangles within a Formatics vertex space define new centers of resolution, enabling self-contained recursion.}

\textbf{Theorem 3.2 — Fractal Self-Similarity of Recursive Vertices}
\[
\forall k: \text{SubV}_k(\mathcal{V}_n(D', r_k)) \equiv \mathcal{V}_n(D, r)
\]
\textit{Explanation: Recursive Formatics vertices inherit all structural rules from their parent vertex space, scaled in size but not in logic.}

---

\textbf{Theorem 3.3 — Geometric Convergence of Recursive Radius}
\[
r_k = s^k \cdot r_0, \quad 0 < s < 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lim_{k \to \infty} r_k = 0

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Theorem 4.2 — Logic Gates as 2D Formatics Structures}

\textit{Context: Logic gates operate conditionally on binary inputs. Formatics reinterprets a gate as a stabilized vertex space: closure only occurs when inputs satisfy the structure.}

\[
\vec{v}_1 = \text{input A} \quad \vec{v}_2 = \text{input B}
\quad D = \{\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, -\vec{v}_1, -\vec{v}_2\}

\quad \text{(AND gate fails to stabilize)}
\]
\[
\vec{v}_1 \land \vec{v}_2 \Rightarrow \text{Stabilize}(V2) \Rightarrow \text{Output}

\textbf{Theorem 4.3 — Recursive Computation as Vertex Tree}

\textit{Context: Recursive functions generate trees of evaluation. Formatics models this as nested vertex spaces, each obeying the same closure rules.}

\textbf{Step 1: Root Call (Initial Vertex)}
\[
\mathcal{V}_n(D_0, r_0) = Vn(\{\vec{v}_1, \dots, \vec{v}_n\}, r_0)
\]

\textbf{Step 2: Recursive Subvertex Generation}
\[
\forall k: r_k = s^k \cdot r_0
\quad \text{and} \quad \text{SubV}_k(Vn(D_k, r_k)) \equiv Vn
\]

\textbf{Step 3: Branches as Directional Paths}
\[
\text{Each call } f_i \Rightarrow \vec{v}_i
\quad \Rightarrow \text{edge in recursive geometry}
\]

\textbf{Step 4: Recursive Stability}
\[
\forall k: \text{AngleClosure}(\text{SubV}_k) = \text{AngleClosure}(Vn)
\Rightarrow \text{Stable}
\]

\textbf{Step 5: Interpretation}

\subsection*{A.5.5 — The Void as Semantic Resolution}

\textbf{Definition: Semantic Result of Stabilization}

Let:
\[
\mathcal{V}_n(D, r) \quad \text{be a stabilized Formatics vertex space}
\]
Then:
\[
\text{SemanticResult}(\mathcal{V}_n) := \text{that which remains or emerges when all triangle-based closure is complete}
\]

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{Observation: This result takes different forms depending on n:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{1D}: \texttt{ResolutionLine} — a stable bidirectional path
  \item \textbf{2D}: \texttt{TensionPoint} — stabilization around a center (no interior void)
  \item \textbf{3D}: \texttt{Void} — a central triangle-void (interior not used in closure)
  \item \textbf{4D}: \texttt{EnclosedVolume} — full tetrahedral spatial resolution
  \item \textbf{n > 4}: \texttt{ResolvedManifold} — high-dimensional surface or form enclosing directional structure
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Therefore:}
\[
\text{Void} \in \texttt{SemanticResult}
\quad \text{but not } \texttt{SemanticResult} \equiv \text{Void}
\]

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{Theorems Involving “Void” Remain Valid Under This View:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Void(V3)} in Theorems 1.3, 4.1, 5.2 — Valid
  \item \texttt{Void(Vn)} for n ≠ 3 — Interpreted as \texttt{SemanticResult(Vn)}
  \item Directional resolution (Stabilize) still defines output meaning
\end{itemize}

Define a polymorphic resolution operator:
\[
\text{Resolve}(Vn(D, r)) \mapsto \texttt{SemanticResult}_n

\textbf{Stabilize(D)}

\textit{Purpose:}  
Reduces a directional set D to the set of stabilized relational enclosures (triangles), based on vector closure logic.

\textbf{Input:}
\[
D = \{ v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n \}, \quad v_i \in \mathbb{R}^d, \|v_i\| = 1
\]

\textbf{Process:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Generate all 3-element subsets of D:
  \[
  \mathcal{T} = \left\{ \{v_i, v_j, v_k\} \mid i < j < k \right\}
  \]

  \item For each triplet:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Ensure vectors are distinct and non-colinear
      \item Form triangle:
      \[
      \Delta_{ijk} := \text{Polygon}(O + v_i,\ O + v_j,\ O + v_k)

    \end{itemize}

  \item Return:
  \[
  T = \left\{ \Delta_{ijk} \mid \text{valid} \right\}
  \]
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Output:}
TriangleSet \( T = \{ \Delta_1, \Delta_2, \dots \} \)  
Each triangle is a minimal relational unit.

\textbf{Failure Modes:}
- \( |D| < 3 \) ⇒ \( T = \emptyset \)  
- All triplets colinear ⇒ \( T = \emptyset \)

\textbf{Evaluation Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Stabilize the direction set:

  360^\circ & n = 2 \\
  180^\circ \cdot \binom{n}{3} & n \geq 3 \\

  \item Compare A to expected:

    \item If \( A = \text{ExpectedClosure}_n \), return:
    \[

\textbf{Rule R7:}  
\[

Where \( F \) is a vertex-dependent **aggregation function** that evaluates the combined resolution results of the subvertices.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Definition: Aggregated Resolve Function \( F \)}

\textit{Interpretation:}  
The parent vertex \( Vn^{(0)} \) does not resolve independently — its output is derived from the stabilization results of its internal components.

\textbf{Example (Recursive Tetrahedron):}
\[
\texttt{SemanticResult}_4 = \texttt{EnclosedVolume}

\textbf{Purpose:}

To define how Formatics resolution expressions reduce to **normal forms**:
- Minimal triangle sets
- Unique resolution outputs
- Consistent results across equivalent derivations

This enables:
- Structural comparison
- Proof optimization

A Formatics evaluation trace reaches normal form if:
- All triangles are valid and closed
- Total angle = ExpectedClosureₙ
- The result is:

\textbf{Interpretation}

Composition is structural, not symbolic

Outputs of stabilized vertex spaces become inputs to downstream structures

Resolution is maintained only if closure and directionality persist

This enables:

Multi-node Formatics circuits

Directional logic trees

Causal chains of resolution

Foundations for Formatics category theory

\textbf{Purpose:}

To define the core types, operator signatures, and output domains of the Formatics evaluation system, enabling:
- Type-checking of evaluation flows
- Function safety and predictability
- Logical consistency of composed systems

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Atomic Types}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Direction}  
    → A normalized vector \( v \in \mathbb{R}^n \), representing a directional input

  \item \texttt{Triangle}  
    → A 2-simplex formed by three non-colinear directions

  \item \texttt{VertexSpace[n]}  
    → A bounded space receiving \( n \) distinct directional vectors

  \item \texttt{AngleSum}  
    → A scalar (in degrees) computed from a set of triangles
\end{itemize}

  \item \texttt{DirectionSet}  
    → Finite set of \texttt{Direction}

  \item \texttt{TriangleSet}  
    → Finite set of \texttt{Triangle}

  \item \texttt{SubVertexList}  
    → Ordered list of \texttt{VertexSpace[n]}

  \item \texttt{ResolutionFormₙ}  
    → Dimension-specific output from a resolved vertex

    \[
    \texttt{ResolutionFormₙ} :=
    \begin{cases}
    \texttt{ResolutionLine} & n = 1 \\
    \texttt{TensionPoint} & n = 2 \\
    \texttt{Void} & n = 3 \\
    \texttt{EnclosedVolume} & n = 4 \\
    \texttt{ResolvedManifold}_n & n > 4
    \end{cases}
    \]

  \item \texttt{ResolvedOutput}  
    → Any \texttt{ResolutionFormₙ} or \texttt{ResolutionFailure}

  \item \texttt{ResolutionFailure} := ⊥  
    → Failure to stabilize due to insufficient direction, invalid geometry, or angle mismatch

  \item \texttt{RecursiveVertexSpace[n]}  
    → A \texttt{VertexSpace[n]} containing a \texttt{SubVertexList}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Operator Type Signatures}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Stabilize}  
    \[
    \texttt{Stabilize} : \texttt{DirectionSet} \to \texttt{TriangleSet}
    \]

  \item \texttt{AngleClosure}  
    \[
    \texttt{AngleClosure} : \texttt{VertexSpace}[n] \to \texttt{AngleSum}
    \]

  \item \texttt{Resolve}  
    \[
    \texttt{Resolve} : \texttt{VertexSpace}[n] \to \texttt{ResolutionFormₙ} \cup \{\bot\}
    \]

  \item \texttt{Resolve} (recursive)  
    \[
    \texttt{Resolve} : \texttt{RecursiveVertexSpace}[n] \to \texttt{ResolutionFormₙ} \cup \{\bot\}
    \]

  \item \texttt{F} (aggregation function)  
    \[
    F : [\texttt{ResolutionForm}_k] \to \texttt{ResolutionForm}_n \cup \{\bot\}
    \]

  \item \texttt{Compose}  
    \[
    \texttt{Compose} : \texttt{VertexSpace}[n] \times \texttt{VertexSpace}[n] \to \texttt{VertexSpace}[n] \cup \{\texttt{InvalidComposition}\}
    \]

  \item \texttt{Direction} ⊂ \texttt{DirectionSet}
  \item \texttt{Triangle} ⊂ \texttt{TriangleSet}
  \item \texttt{ResolutionFormₙ} ⊂ \texttt{ResolvedOutput}
  \item \texttt{VertexSpace[n]} ⊂ \texttt{RecursiveVertexSpace[n]}
  \item ⊥ ∉ \texttt{ResolutionFormₙ}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Failure and Type Invalidation}

\textit{Rules:}

- If \( \texttt{Stabilize}(D) = \emptyset \Rightarrow \texttt{Resolve}(Vn) = \bot \)
- If angle sum ≠ expected closure ⇒ ⊥
- If any subvertex fails ⇒ parent resolution = ⊥
- ⊥ is atomic and terminal — cannot be composed, normalized, or resolved

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Type Compatibility for Composition}

Let:
\[
\texttt{Resolve}(Vn_A) = \texttt{SemanticResult}_A
\quad \text{and} \quad \texttt{SemanticResult}_A \in D_B
\]

Then:
\[
\texttt{Compose}(Vn_A, Vn_B) \Rightarrow Vn_C
\quad \text{else } \texttt{InvalidComposition}
\]

Ensures that only compatible resolution outputs can chain.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Type Flow Example}

Input:
D = {v1, v2, v3, v4}
→ DirectionSet

Stabilize(D)
→ TriangleSet T = {Δ₁, Δ₂, Δ₃, Δ₄}

AngleClosure(V4)
→ 720°

Resolve(V4)
→ ResolutionForm₄ = EnclosedVolume

Normalize(ResolveTrace)
→ NF(V4) = EnclosedVolume : ResolutionForm₄

To formalize the **rewrite and evaluation language** used to process Formatics vertex expressions, transforming them from:
- Direction sets ⇒ triangles ⇒ angle sums ⇒ semantic results  
- While handling failures, composition, and recursive resolution

- Execution
- Proof automation
- Normalization
- Categorical modeling
